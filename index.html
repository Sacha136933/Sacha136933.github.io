  <h1>Uruguay: The Oriental Republic of Uruguay</h1>

<p><strong> History:</strong> Uruguay was inhabited by the Charrúa people for approximately 4,000 years before the Portuguese established Colonia del Sacramento in 1680; Uruguay was colonized by Europeans relatively late compared with neighboring countries. Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the Spanish in the early 18th century, signifying the competing claims over the region. Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828, following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain, and later Argentina and Brazil. It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century, with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics. </strong></p>

<h2>Montevideo</h2>

<p>
  <> Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, is the most European city in Latin America, and also <em> one of the 30 safest cities in the world</em>. Montevideo evokes Buenos Aires but in a smaller, calmer, less oversized way than its big sister. Its old town reveals a <strong>charming historic district, dotted with museums, juggling neoclassical architecture and art deco buildings.</strong> Montevideo also offers a vibrant nightlife and a flourishing and eclectic cultural life. And finally, don't forget the pretty beaches along the coast...
 <br> Montevideo, the port city and capital of Uruguay, is an ideal destination for travellers looking for a relaxing walk along colonial-era houses and beautiful beaches. The Citadel Gate, the only remaining portion of the wall that once encircled the entire city, now serves as a gateway to the Ciudad Vieja, Montevideo's oldest district. Scattered with churches, museums and theatres, at night, the district comes alive thanks to nightclubs, to the rhythm of tango and Candombe for the many dancers.

<h2>Colonia del Sacrament: an atypical city</h2>
<> Colonia del Sacramento is, together with Montevideo and Punta del Este, one of Uruguay's main tourist destinations. Accessible by ferry from Buenos Aires, this small town of 26,000 inhabitants has been classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of the quality of its architecture, which combines Spanish and Portuguese styles. 
<br>
</br>
But the particular character of Colonia del Sacramento is also based on its <strong>urban landscape, a mixture of large arteries and squares, with small cobbled streets and more intimate squares.  The scale of the historic district is marked by the predominant presence of single-storey houses, with two-storey houses being rare.</strong> From the bay, only the profiles of the lighthouse and the church towers stand out. Surrounded by water on three sides, the city's relationship with the river is one of the natural aspects that qualify it most.

<h2>Punta Del Este: the seaside resort</h2>
<> Punta del Este is known as <em>Uruguay's St. Tropez</em> for its superb beaches, high-end hotel complexes and chic and trendy discos.The City of Punta del Este, which is part of the Department of Maldonado, is located on the Southeast end of Uruguay on a long peninsula of sand, woodlands and rocks from which it has taken its name. This is one of the most important and popular tourist destinations in the country, chosen by thousands of visitors of all ages and nationalities. It is a synonym for international jet set, good life and good taste. <strong>Punta del Este is one of those places in the world where everybody wants to return,</strong> maybe because its beautiful beaches are the perfect destination for those who are in search of sunshine, white sand, woodlands, clear waters and much glamour. Between two days of beach and surfing, ride with a local gaucho and ride through the wilderness surrounding the city.

<br>
<p> <em>As it lies on the Río de la Plata side, La Mansa has quiet waters and is protected from the oceanic winds that create rough waves on the shores of La Brava. The famous sculpture known as "The Hand on the Sand", made in 1982, may be seen on this beach. Sophisticated and natural, Punta del Este features a promenade, sumptuous houses, modern buildings, the most luxurious brands, top celebrities, the best restaurants and top-of-the-line hotels.</em>
